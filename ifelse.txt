# Example 1: Basic if-else statement
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")

# Example 2: Nested if-else statements
y = 7
if y > 10:
    print("y is greater than 10")
else:
    if y > 5:
        print("y is greater than 5 but not greater than 10")
    else:
        print("y is not greater than 5")
