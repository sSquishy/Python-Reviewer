# Example 1: Basic if-else statement
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")

# Example 2: Nested if-else statements
y = 7
if y > 10:
    print("y is greater than 10")
else:
    if y > 5:
        print("y is greater than 5 but not greater than 10")
    else:
        print("y is not greater than 5")

# Example 3: Elif (else if) statement
z = 3
if z > 5:
    print("z is greater than 5")
elif z == 5:
    print("z is equal to 5")
else:
    print("z is less than 5")

# Example 4: Ternary conditional expression
a = 15
b = 10
max_value = a if a > b else b
print("The maximum value between a and b is:", max_value)
